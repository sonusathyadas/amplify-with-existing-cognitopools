# Using existing Cognito user pool and identity pool with AWS amplify
With the new Amplify CLI, yyou gain the ability to import existing Amazon Cognito resources into your Amplify project. Just run the “amplify import auth” command and Amplify CLI will automatically configure all your Amplify-provisioned resources (GraphQL APIs, S3 buckets and more) to be authenticated with your designated existing Cognito User Pool or Identity Pool.  

## Pre-requisites:
    * NodeJS 14.x or later
    * Visual Studio Code
    * Install the latest Amplify CLI version using `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`
    * Amplify CLI is already configured with `amplify configure` command.

> [!NOTE]
> To use an existing Cognito user pool, you need to register two client applications in the **App Integration** section of the user pool. One for the web application client and another one for native application. Register the web application client without app secret and register the native client with app secret.

## Create a User pool with Web Client 
1) Sign in to the AWS management console and navigate to Cognito dashboard. Choose the region as `us-east-1`. Navigate to the new Console.
2) Click on the `Create User Pool` button.
3) In the `Configure sign-in experience` page, 
    1) `Cognito user pool` will be selected by default for Provider types. 
    2) For `Cognito user pool sign-in options` select `Username`,`email` and `Phone number`.
    3) Select the checkbox for `Allow users to sign in with a preferred user name` under `User name requirements`.
    4) Click on the `Next` button.
4) In the `Configure security requirements` page,

    3) Click on the `Next` button.
7) In the `Integrate your app` page,
    1) Specify user pool name as `EmployeeAppUserPool`.
    2) Under the `Hosted authentication pages`, select the `Use the Cognito Hosted UI` checkbox.
    3) In the `Domain` configuration page, select `Use a Cognito domain` option and enter a valid domain name prefix in the `Cognito domain` textbox.
    4) In the `Initial app client` section, select the `Public client` as the app type. 
    5) Specify client app name as `Employee Web Portal`.
    6) For the `client secret` choose the `Don’t generate a client secret` option. 
    7) In the `Allowed callback URLs` section, type `http://localhost` as the callback URL. When you build a client application, you can update it with the hosted URL of the client application.
    8) Expand the `Advanced app client settings` section and make sure `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`, `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH` and `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` authentication flows are selected. 
    9) Leave the token configuration parameters values as default.

    2) Enter the `Employee Native App` client app Id.
6) Click on `Create Pool` button.
7) Click on the `Allow` to create the identity pool.

## Setup the backend REST API authentication with Cognito User Pool
1) Open the `employee-api-starter` project in Visual Studio Code.
2) Restore all node packages by running `npm install` command.
3) Install the following npm package to support Cognito authentication.
    ```bash
    npm install --save cognito-express
    ```
4) Create `auth.js` file in the project root folder and add the following code.
    ```javascript
    const CognitoExpress = require('cognito-express')

    // Setup CognitoExpress
    const cognitoExpress = new CognitoExpress({
        region: process.env.REGION,
        cognitoUserPoolId: process.env.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
        tokenUse: "access",
        tokenExpiration: 3600
    })
    
    exports.validateAuth = (req, res, next) => {
        // Check that the request contains a token
        if (req.headers.authorization && req.headers.authorization.split(" ")[0] === "Bearer") {
            // Validate the token
            const token = req.headers.authorization.split(" ")[1]
            cognitoExpress.validate(token, function (err, response) {
                if (err) {
                    // If there was an error, return a 401 Unauthorized along with the error
                    res.status(401).send(err)
                } else {
                    //Else API has been authenticated. Proceed.
                    next();
                }
            });
        } else {
            // If there is no token, respond appropriately 
            res.status(401).send("Access denied, check the access token is sent correctly.")
        }
    }
    ```
5) Open the `routes/employee-routes.js` file and add the following import statement on top.
    ```javascript
    const { validateAuth } = require('../auth')
    ```
6) Update the route for adding a new employee to support JWT token authentication. Use the `validateAuth` middileware for the route to validate JWT token sent by the client application.
    ```javascript
    router.post("/",[validateAuth], async(req,res)=>{
        let employee = req.body;
        let result = await empSvc.addEmployee(employee)
            .catch(err=>{
                console.log(err);
                res.status(500).json({'message':'Unable to add new employee'})
            })
        if(result)
        {
            res.status(201).json({'message':'Employee added successfully'})
        }
    })
    ```
7) Update the `serverless.yml` file to specify the Cognito user pool id which you have created above.
    ```yml
    environment:
        TABLENAME: ${self:custom.tableName}
        NODE_ENV: 'production'
        REGION: 'REGION_HERE'
        COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: 'USER_POOL_ID_HERE'
    ```
8) Deploy the backend API using the following command.
    ```bash
    serverless deploy
    ```
## Configure React applciation with Amplify
1) Open the project `employee-portal-starter` using VS Code.
2) Open the command terminal in the project folder.
3) Initialize the Amplify in the current project folder.
    ```nodejs
    amplify init
    ``` 
    ```
    Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
    ? Enter a name for the project :employeeportal
    The following configuration will be applied:

    ```

4) Import the cognito resources by running the following command:
    ```bash
    amplify import auth
    ```

    ```
    Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation
    √ What type of auth resource do you want to import? · Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
    ✔ Only one Cognito User Pool (ap-south-1_Pj5phYg8U) found and it was automatically selected.
    ✔ Only one Web app client found: 'Employee Web Portal' was automatically selected.
    The User Pool has multiple Native app clients configured.
    √ Select a Native client to import: · 13lu68v3iao9q018f2uq03ka1o
    ✔ Only one Identity Pool resource found: 'EmployeeAppIdentityPool' (ap-south-1:982178eb-0983-42e8-9065-3666b41df1e7) was automatically selected.

    ✅ Cognito User Pool 'EmployeesUserPool' and Identity Pool 'EmployeeAppIdentityPool' was successfully imported.

    Next steps:
    - This resource will be available for GraphQL APIs ('amplify add api')
    - Use Amplify libraries to add signup, signin, signout capabilities to your client application.
        - iOS: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios
        - Android: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/android
        - JavaScript: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js
    ```
5) Now that we’ve imported our Cognito resource into our Amplify project, let’s start to leverage it within our UI. Let’s generate the configuration files by running:
    ```bash
    amplify push
    ```
6) Accept all the default values for the prompted questions. You should see a new `aws-exports.js` file in the `src/` folder with the Cognito resource information. Your `aws-exports.js` file should look something like this:
    ```json
    const awsmobile = {
      "aws_project_region": "YOUR_REGION",
      "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": "YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID",
      "aws_cognito_region": "YOUR_REGION",
      "aws_user_pools_id": "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID",
      "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": "YOUR_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID",
      "oauth": {}
    };
    ```
7) Add the following npm packages to generate the Login and Signup ui elements for  your application
    ```nodejs
    npm install
    npm install --save aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
    ```
8) Open the App.js file in your react application and add the following code below all import statements
    ```javascript
    import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
    import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
    import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
    import awsExports from './aws-exports';
    Amplify.configure(awsExports);
    ```
9) Update the App component code with the following. This will add a signout link and shows currently logged in user name in the navigation bar.
    ```javascript
    function App({ loadEmployees }) {
        loadEmployees();
    
        return (
            <Authenticator loginMechanisms={['username']}>
                {({ signOut, user }) => (
                    <Router>
                        <Navbar bg="dark" variant="dark">
                            <Container>
                                <Navbar.Brand href="#home">{process.env.REACT_APP_APP_NAME}</Navbar.Brand>
                                <Nav className="me-auto">
                                    <Nav.Link as={Link} to="/" >Home</Nav.Link>
                                    <Nav.Link as={Link} to="/about">About</Nav.Link>
                                    <Nav.Link as={Link} to="/contact">Contact</Nav.Link>
                                    <Nav.Link onClick={signOut}>Sign out</Nav.Link>
                                    <Nav.Link href ="#" > Welcome {user.username}</Nav.Link> 
                                </Nav>
                            </Container>
                        </Navbar>
                        <div>
                            <Routes>
                                <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
                                <Route exact path="about" element={<About />}></Route>
                                <Route exact path="contact" element={<Contact />}></Route>
                                <Route exact path="employees/loc/:locId/ecode/:ecode" element={<EmployeeDetail />}></Route>
                                <Route exact path="employees/create" element={<EmployeeForm />} ></Route>
                                <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" />} />
                            </Routes>
                        </div>
                    </Router>
                )}
            </Authenticator>
        );
    }
    ```
10) Now, you can test the applciation locally by running the following commnad.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Consume protected APIs with Access Token
1) Open `src/components/EmployeeForm.jsx` file in the project.
2) Update the `handleSubmit()` code with the following
    ```javascript
    async handleSubmit(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        let session = await Auth.currentSession()
            .catch(err => console.log("Unable to get access token"))
        if (session) {
            let token = session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken();
            const { employee } = this.state;
            this.props.addEmployee(employee, token);
            this.setState({ redirect: true });
        }
        else {
            alert("User not logged in")
        }
    }
    ```
3) Now, open the `src/actions/action-creators.js` file.
4) Update the `addEmployee` method with the following. This will use the access token to call the backend API.
    ```javascript
    export function addEmployee(employee, accessToken) {
        return async (dispatch) => {
            try {
                let options = { headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}` } }
                let result = await axios.post(API_URL, employee, options);//adding to database but not to inmemory state
                //update the state with dispatching an ADD_EMPLOYEE action
                dispatch({
                    type: ActionTypes.ADD_EMPLOYEE,
                    payload: employee
                })
                return Promise.resolve(result.data);
            } catch (err) {
                return Promise.reject(err);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5) Run and test the application
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
